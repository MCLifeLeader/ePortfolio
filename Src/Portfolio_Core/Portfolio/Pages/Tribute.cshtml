            I asked Chat-GPT to write a question and response in the style of C.S. Lewis Screw Tape Letters regarding the martyrdom of a prominent Christian. Let us thwart evil and press ever forward holding Christ's banner high!

            My dearest Uncle,
        </p>
        <p>
            I am unsettled. News has reached me that the wretched man of God — the one, <em>Charlie Kirk</em>, whose words have moved multitudes — has been put to death. I confess I was at first gleeful. Surely his voice is silenced, his lips stopped, his influence buried. But a most unnerving thing follows: the humans do not seem subdued. Instead, they gather in greater numbers, singing with a strange fervor. They speak not of defeat but of “victory.” Some dare call him a martyr. Uncle, I fear we may have miscalculated. Tell me, how do we make this calamity serve <em>our</em> side?

            My dear Wormkin,
        </p>
        <p>
            How little you yet understand the Enemy’s dreadful arithmetic! Do you imagine that removing one of His servants silences Him? Why, martyrdom is among His most abominable inventions. One death multiplies into a thousand voices, echoing through time, until the single act of courage becomes seed for generations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our task, therefore, is not to celebrate the killing — the Enemy will twist it into triumph if left unchecked — but to corrupt the memory. Turn their awe into idolatry of the man rather than worship of the Enemy. Let them quarrel over his sayings, debate his motives, divide into parties: “I follow Paul,” “I follow Apollos,” and so forth. You must make them argue over relics, anniversaries, and monuments until the purity of his witness is smothered beneath politics and pride.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even better, tempt them into despair. Whisper that if such a holy man could be struck down, what hope is there for ordinary believers? Feed their fear that faith inevitably ends in suffering. If they tremble at that prospect rather than rejoice in it, we shall yet wring profit from the incident.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember this, nephew: the death itself we could not prevent — but the interpretation is still within our claws. Make the story about the man, or about the tragedy, or about the futility of sacrifice. Only never about the Enemy’s Son, who turned His own execution into the very door of their salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you succeed, the martyr’s blood will harden into dust, not blossom into seed.
        </p>

            Your affectionate uncle,<br />
