            This is a personal project that I have undertaken to create example applications that demonstrate, what I believe, is a nice way
            to structure an application. The project architecture and layout is based on my years of experience and learning from other 
            amazing developers and software engineers. The project is a work in progress and I will be adding more examples as I have time.
