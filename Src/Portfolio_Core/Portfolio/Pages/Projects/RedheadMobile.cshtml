        <h3>Redhead Mobile Project 2017</h3>
        <p>
            Redhead mobile apps provided custom mobile applications for Independent Insurance Agencies.
            The work that was undertaken was to update their API services to enable expansion of their products and services and increase
            the overall performance of their product. The primary data that they were attempting to include was a merger with QQ Catalyst
            and the older Vertafore APIs. Unfortunately, the project was ended when the costs related to licensing the Vertafore
            API’s was going to be too high.

            Sadly it appears that the company is no longer in business and the website is no longer active.
