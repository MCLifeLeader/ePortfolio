            You may ask, "Why such a span of time from starting college to today?" The answer: "I primarily went to college to have fun and gain an education on my own terms."
            My ultimate reason for attending college was for a personal goal and not for the scholastic need for a degree. By the time I attended college I was well on my way
            to earning my own living without the degree education provided, for me it was a personal goal that I would earn a bachelor’s degree. Not only do I believe in being
            honorable and truthful with others I work with, but I also believe that we need to honor and be truthful to ourselves first!

        <p>
            Earning my Associates was a practical move to cap my foundational studies. I had several classes that I had taken where the credit for the class was
            about to expire at the time.

            Originally I had planned to earn a Computer Science Degree. However, the degree that I earned better fit the direction that I had moved in regards to my
            active career.
