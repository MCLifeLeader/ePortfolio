		<h3>AdverTran Project</h3>
		<p>
			This was a collabrartive project that I started and began development of in 2007. It's use is for creating and managing playlists
			for onscreen advertising in theaters or other locations for digital media and content advertising. The first link is to the 
			marketing page that was developed and the second link launches the actual application.
