		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			I have had the opportunity to develop on both personal and corporate large scale applications, primarily in web and API services.
			During my career I have successfully developed from conception to release four different web based applications,
			refactored a SaaS application into an N-Tier structure and helped release two new services, a SOA Layer and Notification Service.
			I also pave the way for the development and release of a mobile application for iOS and Android.
			Additionally, I functioned as the development lead of six other developers working closely with the project manager where I was tasked with various responsibilities.
			I additionally implemented Continuous Integration with automated deployment and functioned as the release manager for all services,
			which included developing SQL update scripts for deployments. Most recently I was the principle QA Automation Engineer where I designed
			and began implementation for a customized load testing framework for large translation system workflows.
			Lastly, I had the distinct privilege of working with and mentoring an intern from Weber State University in the testing of
			REST APIs and quality assurance responsibilities and duties.
