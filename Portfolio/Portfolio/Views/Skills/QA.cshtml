      <h3>Filing Defects / Bugs</h3>
      <p>
         The process for filing defects or bugs will depend on the company or department that you are in.
         One of the most important aspects of filing defects is the ability to communicate the steps necessary
         to replicate the issue that was found. As a Quality Assurance Engineer in Software Testing you need to
         balance the level of details so that you are not being overly verbose but providing enough clarity for
         the issue to be replicated step by step. The other benefit to creating clear reproduction steps is that
         these new steps become the details to be included as a new test case in your test suite.
      </p>
      <p>
         Something that I have also found that greatly helps in the remediation of a defect is the use of screen
         capture or video recording software during the testing cycle. Using such tools makes it perfectly clear
         what happened how and when. However, relying solely on video or screen capture is not sufficient. It is
         still important to convert the video reproduction into verbal steps so that you can add it to your test
         suite later and often the written word is faster to follow than watching a video. Videos and screen
         captures serve to supply nuanced details that maybe missed through written reproduction steps.
      </p>
      <p>
         Lastly, as QA it was important to have a level of separation of concerns when triaging defects. QA was
         responsible for setting the severity of the defect and the product owner set the priority for fixing the
         defect. Listed below was the basic severity breakdown that we used when classifying defects.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-group">
         <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-text">
            Severity 1
            <ul class="list-group">
               <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-text">
                  Completely broken and unable to proceed and the functionality of the software is non-functional.
                  There is a code stack trace with exception details, or the functionality does not work at all.
                  This would also extend to translations that are offensive or completely wrong.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-text">
            Severity 2
            <ul class="list-group">
               <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-text">
                  The functionality is badly broken from a UX / UI perspective. There is a work around for the
                  user but may involve support manually making changes in the database or working with the user
                  one on one to work past the broken point.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-text">
            Severity 3
            <ul class="list-group">
               <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-text">
                  The functionality is working but not optimally. There is a relatively easy work around that
                  the user can be trained to follow. This would also be the defect level for most UX / UI issues.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-text">

            <ul class="list-group">
               <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-text">
                  Minor UI / UX issue and would include grammatical issues such as spelling or punctuation
                  that is incorrect.
