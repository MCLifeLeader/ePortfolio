      <h3>Test Case Development</h3>
      <p>
         The basic premise behind the development of test cases is to cover the functional behavior of something,
         typically software, for verifying the functionality, quality, and usability meets design requirements.
         Test cases should cover input, preconditions, and a set of execution steps with the expected behavior or
         results after completing those various steps and are typically combined into a group of test cases call a
         test plan. Lastly, a test case’s steps can be manually or automatically executed though procedural scripts
         or code by a test engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
         My primary experience in the development of test cases and test suites has been using tools such 
         as Azure DevOps (VSTS, TFS). I would then execute those tests one by one and report on the results of those tests.
         As a Software Development Engineer in Test or SDET I would often automate manual test cases and create automated scripts
         or software code that would then test the product in a similar and reputable process each time.

      <h3>Filing Defects / Bugs</h3>
      <p>
         The process for filing defects or bugs will depend on the company or department that you are in.
         One of the most important aspects of filing defects is the ability to communicate the steps necessary
         to replicate the issue that was found. As a Quality Assurance Engineer in Software Testing you need to
         balance the level of details so that you are not being overly verbose but providing enough clarity for
         the issue to be replicated step by step. The other benefit to creating clear reproduction steps is that
         these new steps become the details to be included as a new test case in your test suite.
      </p>
      <p>
         Something that I have also found that greatly helps in the remediation of a defect is the use of screen
         capture or video recording software during the testing cycle. Using such tools makes it perfectly clear
         what happened how and when. However, relying solely on video or screen capture is not sufficient. It is
         still important to convert the video reproduction into verbal steps so that you can add it to your test
         suite later and often the written word is faster to follow than watching a video. Videos and screen
         captures serve to supply nuanced details that maybe missed through written reproduction steps.
      </p>
      <p>
         Lastly, as QA it was important to have a level of separation of concerns when triaging defects. QA was
         responsible for setting the severity of the defect and the product owner set the priority for fixing the
         defect. Listed below was the basic severity breakdown that we used when classifying defects.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-group">
         <li class="list-group-item">
            Severity 1
            <ul class="list-group">
               <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info font-weight-bolder">
                  Completely broken and unable to proceed and the functionality of the software is non-functional.
                  There is a code stack trace with exception details, or the functionality does not work at all.
                  This would also extend to translations that are offensive or completely wrong.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li class="list-group-item">
            Severity 2
            <ul class="list-group">
               <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info font-weight-bolder">
                  The functionality is badly broken from a UX / UI perspective. There is a work around for the
                  user but may involve support manually making changes in the database or working with the user
                  one on one to work past the broken point.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li class="list-group-item">
            Severity 3
            <ul class="list-group">
               <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info font-weight-bolder">
                  The functionality is working but not optimally. There is a relatively easy work around that
                  the user can be trained to follow. This would also be the defect level for most UX / UI issues.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li class="list-group-item">
            Severity 4
            <ul class="list-group">
               <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info font-weight-bolder">
                  Minor UI / UX issue and would include grammatical issues such as spelling or punctuation
                  that is incorrect.
