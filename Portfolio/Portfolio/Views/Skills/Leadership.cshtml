         This page highlights my learning and personal development path for my self directed education into leadership. I certainly don't know it all, however, I have
         a strong desire to be the best leader and mentor I can where ever I am at. Leadership and I mean real leadership is something earned over years of hard work
         and character building and is easily lost through the misuse of that leadership.

      <h3>Scrum Master</h3>
      <p>
         I have had the opportunity to work in various agile companies since 2009. My first experience with the Agile started while working for Microsoft.
         Since then I each company that I have worked for has utilized one form or another of the Agile methodologies. While working for Swipeclock they
         decided to invest in our team by training all of us in Agile. We each received our Scrum Master certification through the Platinum Edge training
         program. Since then I have assisted in maintaining and keeping Agile practices where ever I have been. While at Academy Mortgage I was asked to
         be one of their Scrum Master’s and create training for our teams and Scrum Masters.

      <h3>Quality Assurance Lead</h3>
      <p>
         While working for the LDS Church's ICS department in their Content and Media division I had the choice opportunity to help mentor
         and train an Intern in the art and skills of Software Quality Assurance and automation testing. Having the chance to help mentor was
         an absolute blast and I look forward to functioning in that capacity in the future.

      <h3>Development Lead</h3>
      <p>
         As I have grown in my experience as a Software Engineer I have sought opportunities to be a leader among my peers. As a part of that
         career path I have been able to function in the capacity as a development lead. It has been a wonderful introduction into the
         area of leadership and team management and I look forward for further opportunities as I grow in my career.

      <h3>Two Year Service Mission</h3>
      <p>
         I spent two years, on a service mission serving and helping people in the Tempe and Mesa Arizona area. I also had the choice opportunity
         to work and serve among the Native American people on the Glia River Reservation. I followed a regular daily morning and evening routine. There were numerus service
         projects, opportunities of meeting and working with people on the street, and in their homes. It was hard work and well worth the time and lessons learned in
         completing it.
