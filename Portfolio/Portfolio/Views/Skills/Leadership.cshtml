         This page highlights my learning and personal development path for my self directed education into leadership. I certainly don't know it all, however, I have
         a strong desire to be the best leader and mentor I can where ever I am at. Leadership and I mean real leadership is something earned over years of hard work
         and character building and is easily lost through the misuse of that leadership.

      <p>
         While working for Academy Mortgage Corporation I became the DevOps Manager. One of the key directives I was provided was helping to drive automation adoption
         throughout Academy's IT department. This included Development, Operations, Information Security, and Support. One of the key projects that I championed was that
         of the adoption of SaltStack. With the key efforts of my primary DevOps Engineer SaltStack Enterprise was purchased and deployed within our environment. Before
         that we used SaltOpen. This open source stack based solution helped us to begin the process of automating infrastructure as code, automatic deployments
         of web and server Certs and automatic remediation of systems or services based on alerting and notifications.
      </p>
      <p>
         The primary tool that we managed as a part of our day to day processes was Azure DevOps from Microsoft where we managed projects, source code repositories, and
         the building and deployment of code through Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process pipelines. We created pipelines for a number of
         deployment scenarios and depending upon the specified branch we would have an automatic build begin to build that particular branch's code. One the build was
         complete and the artifacts were stored on the build server the next job would begin, deployment. From there the deployment job would be initiated and would
         grab the newly created artifacts and push it out to the target deployment server.
      </p>
      <p>
         Production build and deployments were handled slightly differently. Anyone could start a build for the production <span class="font-weight-bolder">master</span>
         branch. However, deployments would need to go through an approval process. This was handled through our Change Advisory Board, which I was a member of.
         Change requests would be created detailing the change item, when it was to be deployed, risk assessment, rollback plans, tests, business approval, and most importantly
         impact communication plan.
      </p>
      <p>
         Something that is very important to me is self development and improvement and while I was the DevOps and QA manager for Academy Mortgage I had taken up
         additional activities around training and education. Each month I hosted a brown bag lunch for anyone who would like to attend and was interested
         in becoming a better Citizen Developer. This included various technologies and skill sets such as QA, Power Apps, Power Automate, C#, JavaScript,
         or any coding project. The Citizen Developer project was something that I organized and promoted within Academy Mortgage. What I would do was host a lunch and learn
         at least once a month where anyone who was a Software Engineer all the way down to a regular team member wanting to be a Citizen Developer and contributor
         could participate. Ideally, a different team would present at the lunch and learn and the presentation would be recorded. I would take the recording, edit it,
         and then post the video for everyone to have access to it on Microsoft's Stream video hosting service. Additional resources and materials were also posted on
         The Citizen Developer SharePoint site.

      <h3 id="QAManager">Quality Assurance Lead / Manager</h3>
      <p>
         During my second contract working for the LDS Church's ICS department in their Content and Media division I had the choice opportunity to mentor and train an
         intern, that had been attending classes at Weber State, in the art and skills of Software Quality Assurance and Automation Testing. I provided training in
         testing fundamentals including filing defects, creating test cases and test suites, and lastly assisted and guided in the development of automated API tests.
      </p><p>
         After the contract concluded I hired on at Academy Mortgage Corporation as a Senior Software Engineer. After about a year I decided that I wanted to go into
         leadership and go into management. From there I briefly was the team lead for the one of the development teams but quickly was asked to take over
         responsibilities for DevOps and the ServiceNow team. However, this was short and I was transitioned over to managing the DevOps and Quality Assurance Team.
      </p><p>
         As the manager for the Quality Assurance (QA) team, I helped mentor and guide team members in better management of Test Cases and Test Suites with in Azure
         DevOps. Some testing strategies and in improving the approach for using the Page Object Model for our development of automated User Interface testing. One of
         the tools that we use as Academy for Automation is a product called Ranorex. This tool as a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tool that is designed for test
         engineers to both created click and record-based tests but also has the power to manage and create test automation suites that are dynamic.
      </p><p>
         Though the tool was designed for automating tests for web it was decided that using Selenium Web Driver was the better route. From there I created a Selenium
         Web Test Example using C# and Visual Studio as the IDE. This provided a framework to highlight different Development technologies and techniques in the QA
         Automation and Engineering discipline. I then provided this example project to my team members to illustrate an example of the design patterns that I wanted
         us to adopt at Academy Mortgage.
      </p><p>
         Lastly, I had the distinct privilege of updating the Definition of the QA Engineering Role and organized and conducted interviews and made the final decision
         for hiring for our fourth Quality Assurance team member. This included a three round interview process where I performed the initial interview and then
         coordinated with both my team and then management for the final round. I also created a QA challenge questionnaire that requested from the candidates to
         perform some development work and other QA tasks that they would be asked to conduct on a day to day basis. Once I complete my hiring process I am
         looking forward to working with the Human Resources department to separate and update the QA role between a functional test engineer and an automation
         test engineer creating the role within academy as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET).

      <h3 id="ScrumMaster">Scrum Master</h3>
      <p>
         I have had the opportunity to work in various agile companies since 2009. My first experience with the Agile started while working for Microsoft.
         Since then I each company that I have worked for has utilized one form or another of the Agile methodologies. While working for Swipeclock they
         decided to invest in our team by training all of us in Agile. We each received our Scrum Master certification through the Platinum Edge training
         program. Since then I have assisted in maintaining and keeping Agile practices where ever I have been. While at Academy Mortgage I was asked to
         be one of their Scrum Master’s and create training for our teams and Scrum Masters.

         I spent two years, on a service mission serving and helping people in the Tempe and Mesa Arizona area. I also had the choice opportunity
         to work and serve among the Native American people on the Glia River Reservation. I followed a regular daily morning and evening routine. There were numerus service
         projects, opportunities of meeting and working with people on the street, and in their homes. It was hard work and well worth the time and lessons learned in
         completing it.
