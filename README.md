# Michael Carey's ePortfolio
This project is a collection of content and information to demonstrate and document my skills, experience, and academic growth.

## Work in Progress
My ePortfolio is a work in progress and will continually be an evolving project that will continue to grow and improve as I update it periodically.

## Reasons for Creating it
1. Class assignment in CS 308 Technical Communication
2. To provide demonstratable evidence of my skills and experience to prospective clients.
3. Potentially provide ideas, thoughts, and answers to information seekers.
